# TODO
- [ ] Implement `test_controller.py` to run like `moteus_gui` without a gui. 
- [ ] Get moteus motor to stop cleanly on shutdown
- [ ] We should draw out on a whiteboard the max_torque philosophy/plan before it turns into a 3-headed hydra, then refactor/implement
- [ ] Implement the on/off functionality (should stop motors and turn back on by demand without resetting sensor fusion)
