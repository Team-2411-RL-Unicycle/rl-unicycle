# TODO
- [ ] Implement `test_controller.py` to run like `moteus_gui` without a gui. 
- [X] Get moteus motor to stop cleanly on shutdown - simon/motor_on_off (needs testing)
- [ ] We should draw out on a whiteboard the max_torque safety plan and intention and refactor/cleanup the number of instances.
- [x ] Implement the on/off functionality (should stop motors and turn back on by demand without resetting sensor fusion)  - simon/motor_on_off (needs testing)
